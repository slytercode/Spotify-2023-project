# Spotify 2023 — Predicting Streams & Hit Likelihood

Goal: identify the drivers of track success (streams) and estimate the probability of a hit (top 10%).  
Deliverable: clean EDA, baseline regression/classification models, key visuals, and a clear README.

## Project structure
- \data/\: raw, interim, processed  
- \
otebooks/\: 01_eda.ipynb, 02_features.ipynb, 03_models.ipynb  
- \src/\: reusable Python functions (preprocess, features, train, evaluate)  
- \eports/\: plots and concise recruiter-oriented report  

## Roadmap (MVP)
1. Ingestion + basic EDA  
2. Baseline regression and classification  
3. Feature importance + 3–4 key visuals in the README
